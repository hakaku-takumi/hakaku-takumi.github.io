        <p>My name is Felipe Lobo Barros Sant'Ana</p>
        <p>I'm a 17 year old portuguese student who always took some interest in programming. I started programming in Unity, a very powerful game engine, with a lot of awesome tutorials available on Youtube (I really want to emphasize how amazing Sebastian Lague's Youtube Channel is).</p>
        <p>However, it was only with CS50x that I really scratched that itch of knowing how all of this actually works, and so far I really have no complaints about it, it's an amazing course teached by one of the best teachers I have ever seen.</p>
        <p>So here is my attempt to create a website for the problem set of week 8, and with this I really got to know that I won't ever probably be working on web development again (CSS has been a real pain to learn) unless I discover some easier way of doing all this.</p>
        <p>For the website, if I recall correctly I utilized the 'cards' class from Bootstrap and I also used 'Formspree' for the email form in the 'Contact Me' page.</p>
